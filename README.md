# Tile Game

This project uses React and Typescript. The goal here was to work with these technologies to further my understanding of both.

The game will present the user with a certain tile. The user aims to guess how many times this tile will occur in a 5x4 grid. The grid is randomly generated and each tile within it could be one of four different symbols.

Run `npx create-react-app my-react-app --template typescript` in the terminal. Remove some extraneous files.

Key components:

- The 'certain tile'
- A form for the guess
  - Input (number)
